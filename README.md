**_CRAFTIFUL_ IS STILL IN BETA.**
Many features are still missing and some might look a bit wonky as they are still under construction - especially the GUI. But they will be fixed soon enough.

Waxed indicators for Snapshot features won't be added until 1.21.9 pre-release.

_Craftiful_ adds a bit of beauty and a hint of utility into your Minecraft world - you could say it's a beautility pack!

This pack should also work with modern versions older than 1.21.5, though some features might not be compatible.

# What is Craftiful?
Craftiful is born from one simple idea: How can you get more out of Minecraft visually without changing the vibe of its looks? Craftiful aims to amplify Minecraft's immersion and improve on its visuals without taking too much liberty in changing the vibe of the game. Additionally, there are quite a few utility tweaks that we feel should be in the game for accessibility or simplicity reasons.
But behold, this pack is far from finished! Make sure to show up every once in a while to get new features.

# What's added?
The current build of _Craftiful_ has distinguishable Potions, animation to distinguish Waxed Copper in your inventory, variated Lily Pads and a handful of other features. Personally, I would recommend that you just jump into the pack and discover the new stuff all by yourself. But if you want to be prepared, here are all the current features:

<summary>Features</summary>

## 3D Block Models

Some models in the game are pretty flat, so we gave them more depth. These blocks include:

all Bar types (except Waxed Copper) • all Door types • all Rail types • all Trapdoor types • Frogspawn • Glow Lichen • Ladder • Leaf Litter • Lily Pad • Resin Clump • Sculk • Spawner • Trial Spawner • Vault • Ominous Vault • Vines • Chains • Brewing Stand

## 3D Item Models

Isn't it odd that some blocks are displayed as proper blocks, while other have dedicated icon textures? Well, this pack makes these blocks blocky again:

all Bar types (except Waxed Copper) • all Campfire types • all Door types • all Lantern types (except Waxed Copper) • all Torch types • Armor Stand • Bell • Brewing Stand • Cauldron • Flower Pot • Hopper • Lever • Mace (in hand) • Redstone Comparator • Redstone Repeater • Tripwire Hook • and these aren't even all that are planned!

And don't worry, most of these will still display as sprites in Item Frames!

Fences, Fence Gates and Shelves have also been rotated in the inventory to now face the direction of incoming light.

## Tiled Slabs and Stairs

Slabs, Stairs and Walls of polished blocks love to simply cut off at edges instead of continuing their pattern to the end. This is now "fixed" for the following block types (Walls are still WIP):

Polished Andesite • Polished Diorite • Polished Granite • Polished Blackstone • Polished Deepslate • Polished Tuff • Prismarine Bricks • Quartz • Sandstone • Cut Sandstone • Red Sandstone • Red Cut Sandstone

## Variated Textures
Looking at the world can feel a bit same-y in Minecraft, so this pack wants to add variations to some natural blocks. But currently, we can only offer Lily Pads and Cracked Stone Bricks.

## Item Optmizations

Small and nifty tweaks to help you tell your items apart in your inventory. Current additions are:

- shiny Waxed Copper to tell it apart from unwaxed Copper (not including 1.21.9 features)
- distinguishable textures for Potions in all variants
- distinguishable textures for Ominous Bottles
- distinguishable textures for Paintings
- distinguishable textures for Axolotl Buckets

## Redstone Indicators

- Droppers, Dispensers and Observers show the direction they are facing from all sides
- Hoppers show subtile direction indication on their inside and the upper outside section
- Observer activation is indicated on all sides
- Sticky Pistons can be identified from all angles

## Retextures and Remodeling

- TNT is now less muddy
- the sides of Wet Farmland show a moist gradient
- the GUI is currently being reworked
- the sides of regular Piston heads have been changed to accomodate tiling
- Piston bars now resemble their Bedrock counterparts
- Leaf Litter only shows as a quarter if dropped
